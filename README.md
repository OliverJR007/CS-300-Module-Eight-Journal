In the projects for this course, I focused on designing and analyzing data structures to efficiently organize and retrieve course information for a university advising system. The first project required analyzing runtime and memory efficiency for different data structures—vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees—while the second project involved implementing a working course planner that could sort and display courses in alphanumeric order using a binary search tree. The main problem was to determine which data structure would best balance speed, scalability, and maintainability when handling course data. Understanding how different data structures store and access data helped me make design decisions that directly impacted performance and user experience.

Throughout the projects, I encountered challenges such as handling file input errors, ensuring sorted output, and debugging issues with tree traversal and course lookups. I overcame these obstacles by breaking problems down into smaller steps, using pseudocode to clarify logic, and testing my program incrementally. These projects strengthened my understanding of algorithmic complexity and showed me how essential clean, modular design is for scalability. I also learned to write more maintainable and adaptable code by applying consistent formatting, clear function names, and logical separation of concerns. Overall, this work has expanded my approach to software design by teaching me to evaluate trade-offs between efficiency and readability, which will be crucial as I continue developing robust, real-world applications.
